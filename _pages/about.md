A master’s student at the entomology department. I work at the Krishnan’s lab at the university of Maryland. We do pesticide toxicity studies, risk assessment and use adverse outcome pathway to understand the effect of pesticides. I undertake toxicity bioassays and residue analysis for samples taking from the field. I generate dose-response curves and assess foliar risk.
